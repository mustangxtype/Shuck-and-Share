# Shuck and Share
A collaboration between the MDC and several local seafood restaurants. Shucked oyster shells from the restaurants are converted into new reef-building materials through volunteer efforts. The shells will be kept out of the landfill and recycled back into the natural system.<br>

# How To Get Setup
1. Download the .zip file or clone this repo onto your computer<br>
2. For Mac users, download MAMP:<br>
   https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/<br>
   For Windows users, download WAMPServer:<br>
   http://www.wampserver.com/en/#download-wrapper<br>
   These programs will create a local server for you to edit the WordPress
   site<br>
3. Once WAMP/MAMP is downloaded follow your respective instructions

# Mac Users
1. The only part of MAMP you will need to mess with is the Document Root which 
   is located under the Web Server tab.<br>
2. In the Web Server section, location Document Root and click the arrow the 
   right of it.<br>
3. Here, you will navigate to the repository you downloaded earlier. This should
   be the WordPress files that MAMP will use to host.<br> 
4. Navigate back to the main section and select Start Servers.<br>
5. Finally, in your preferred web browser type in: localhost:7888/wp-login.php<br>

# Windows Users
1. During installation you will be prompted with PHP and mail parameters, for now, 
  leave that alone and continue the installation process.
2. "If you click 'Finish' and the software does launch, a WampServer icon will appear in the systems tray."<br>
3. If connected try logging into wordpress by typing in "localhost" on your web browser<br>

Here is the information for the WAMP if troubleshooting is needed.
